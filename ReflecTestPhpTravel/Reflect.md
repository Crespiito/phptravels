#Reflection on the automation

- the exam here presented used a test considered to be a System Test or Ui Test because these tests  focus on the 
  critical functionality provided when all the modules of the system working together.

- An Integrated test works well for testing each individual part of the system.  However, it does not evaluate how the 
  different parts work together. Often times, a system can fail at the point of integration if there are inconsistencies
  between the different parts.  Therefore, I chose an e2e test.  An e2e test tests the integration of the system to ensure that all the different pieces communicate between each other.
