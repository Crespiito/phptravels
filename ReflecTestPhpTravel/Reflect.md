#Reflection on the automation

- the written will be considered as System test or Ui test because these are focused in a critical functionality 
  provided by all the modules of the system working together.

- Another possibility to automate these scenarios is as an integration test where we will test each functionality 
 separately and make sure that each one works correctly it will be fine if we want to certify a specific functionality
 but we may find some errors with other modules when performing the test e2e
